TODO list for rotcelloc, in no particular order:
- Factor out header remapping into an external file to make additions easier
- Generate the filenames for images locally.
    The current version can theoretically result in conflicts (and rotcelloc will
    tell the user if one occurred)
- Package rotcelloc for installation through npm
- Allow the webapp to run in "local" mode, with local copies of the CDN files
